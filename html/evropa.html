<h1>Europe</h1>

<em>Summer, 2022</em>

<p>As of August 23rd, 2022 I am traveling Europe. Here are described events and locations that were interesting. This page will be updated as I progress across the continent.</p>

<p>Below you will find a map of the route I have taken through Europe so far. Do not try to comprehend the logic to it. Just trust that it was devised using cutting edge pathfinding optimization algorithms that mere humans will never fully understand.</p>
