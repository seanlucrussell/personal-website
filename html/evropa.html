<h1>This is the personal website of Sean Luc Russell.</h1>

<p>While this is meant to serve as a blog and portfolio for this SLR, it is also an experiment in web development. I'm new to this, so I'm learning on the fly. The current generation is built on top of a DigitalOcean VM, with domain hosted by SiteGround. The server runs in an nginx docker container. I'm also testing out htmx for the interactive portion of the website.</p>
