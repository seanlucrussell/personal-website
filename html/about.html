<p>This is the personal website of Sean Luc Russell.</p>

<p>While this site is meant to serve as a blog and portfolio, it is also an experiment in web development. I'm new to this, so I'm learning on the fly. The current generation is built on top of a DigitalOcean VM, with domain hosted by SiteGround. The server runs in an nginx docker container. I'm also testing out htmx for the interactive portion of the website (I like it a lot so far. The only drawback is it doesn't work well with the browser history, so things like the back button and page reloads behave unintuitively).</p>
